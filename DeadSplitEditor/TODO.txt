TODO:
check if todos are up to date or if some are already done
make a better ui tbh
 -> avoidance editor crashes if you try to open a video after closing the editor with a video previously loaded (dll probably gets deinitialized? it straight up segfaults, no exception at all)
 -> Make sure you can always open the icon editor, even if there's no icon to click on currently loaded
add a copy button to copy layouts
display current attack name somewhere, update as video plays
make selecting the attack work with one click, jumping to its end with double click (but make it work better than it does now, shouldn't select it when double clicking?)
add support for different StartTrigger options (e.g. GameRestart)
add feedback when saving the layout file -> warning before closing without saving the boss
make "New Boss" button work
add Shift command (shift all attacks by X frames)
figure out how to make the inherited XML nodes serialize last instead of first
investigate crash on clicking X to remove an attack (Might be related to an empty time string it tried to convert?)
add death detector editor (detect type="file"?) autodetect which bytes change and add offsets for it?
add address editor (implement CE(-like) functionality?)
add mouseover for video player ui elements (attack keystones (attack name, timings), play/pause button, frame-advance button etc)
add support for grouping attacks
add shortcut to jump to beginning of attack instead of Alt+Enter jumping to the end

add editor for bosses that aren't avoidace-based?

Done:
(v) Add Alt+Left/Right to move to next/previous attack
(v) Keyboard shortcut to move to selected attack -> Alt+Enter
(v) When creating new attacks, automatically select the textbox for it's name
(v) Icon editor doesn't seem to work and also crashes when reopening it
